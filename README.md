# Electric-vehicles-data-analysis-
 This Tableau dashboard provides an overview and analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data in the United States. It includes filters for EV Type, State, and Model, and visualizes key metrics through various charts and maps
Key Metrics & Visualizations:

1. Top KPIs (at the top):

Total Vehicles: 150,437

Avg Electric Range: 67.86 miles

Total BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles): 116,771 (77.62%)

Total PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles): 33,675 (22.38%)



2. Total Vehicles by Model Year (line/area chart):

Steady growth from 2011 to 2023, peaking at 37.1K in 2023

Noticeable dip in 2024 (only 0.6K), possibly due to incomplete data



3. Total Vehicles by State (map):

California dominates with 50,106 EVs

States like Texas, Florida, and New York have significantly fewer EVs



4. Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make (bar chart):

TESLA leads with 68,960 vehicles (52.71%)

Followed by NISSAN, CHEVROLET, FORD, and BMW



5. Total Vehicle by CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) Eligibility (donut chart):

62,911 vehicles (41.82%) are CAFV eligible

17,829 (11.85%) are not eligible

69,697 (46.33%) are unknown status



6. Total Vehicles by Model (table):

Model Y (Tesla): 18.95%

Model 3 (Tesla): 18.42%

Leaf (Nissan): 8.77%

Tesla clearly leads with several models in the top rankings



# Insights:

Tesla is the dominant EV manufacturer with over half of all EVs on the road.

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) make up the majority (over 77%) of total EVs, indicating a strong shift towards fully electric vehicles.

California is the epicenter of EV adoption in the U.S., far ahead of other states.

Recent years (2020–2023) show rapid EV growth, especially 2023, indicating increasing consumer adoption.

There’s a substantial portion of vehicles with unknown CAFV eligibility, pointing to potential data quality or reporting gaps.



# Conclusion:

The dashboard reveals a strong national trend towards EV adoption, with Tesla as the clear market leader. BEVs are significantly more prevalent than PHEVs, and California leads the way in deployment. The spike in 2023 suggests accelerated adoption, likely due to policy incentives, improving infrastructure, and consumer interest. However, there's room to improve data accuracy, especially concerning CAFV eligibility status.
